For my Final Product, I  created a functioning machine learning model to generate predictive stock market analysis based on news and social media. Through developing this app, I enhanced my ability to apply various technologies in machine learning. I’ve heard time and time again that the best way to learn something is by doing it, and this project enables me to maximize that statement to its full effect. Furthermore, I hope to gain insight into new technologies through discussions with various industry professionals and widen my skill set to be more concurrent with current industry trends.
